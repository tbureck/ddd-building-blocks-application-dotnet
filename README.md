# DDD Building Blocks: Application

DDD Building Blocks is a collection of projects targeted at developers to provide simple yet powerful tools to quickly 
bootstrap an application using tactical Domain Driven Design patterns.

The Application project contains basic interfaces to implement use case level services that use Domain layer services 
and classes.

It builds upon the MediatR project in order to integrate between the components and the encompassing application.
